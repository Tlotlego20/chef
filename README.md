This app is designed to help chefs or restaurant owners manage their menu by allowing them to add, view, and purchase dishes. The app follows a simple flow that involves adding menu items, viewing a home screen with options to navigate the app, viewing the available dishes, adding them to a cart, and finally proceeding to checkout to finalize a purchase. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the app works and its functionality:

1. Add Dish Screen (Menu Management)
The "Add Dish Screen" is where chefs can input information about a new dish. The interface provides several fields:

Dish Name: The name of the dish (e.g., "Sushi" or "Burger").
Description: A description of the dish that can include details like ingredients, preparation method, or serving size.
Course: The type of course the dish belongs to, such as "Starter," "Main," or "Dessert."
Price: The price of the dish in Rands (South African currency), ensuring that the price is a valid positive number.
When all fields are filled out correctly, the chef can press the "Add Dish" button to submit the dish, which will then be added to the list of available menu items. If any fields are missing or incorrect (e.g., if the price is not a valid number), an alert will prompt the user to correct the information.

2. Home Screen
The Home Screen is the main entry point of the app. It provides a welcoming interface with a background image and logo, designed to give the app a visually appealing and professional look.

From this screen, the user has the option to navigate to other parts of the app:

View Menu: The user can view the current list of available dishes and their prices. This allows them to browse what’s on offer.
Add Dish: The user can navigate to the "Add Dish Screen" to create new menu items. This is useful for chefs who want to continuously update their menu with new dishes.
The Home Screen sets the tone of the app and serves as the gateway to the core functionalities.

3. Menu Listing and Item Selection
In this part of the app, the user can view the menu, which is displayed in the form of a list of dishes. Each dish shows:

Dish Name: The name of the dish.
Price: The price in Rands (e.g., "R99.99").
Users can tap on a dish to add it to their cart. Upon selecting a dish, an alert will notify the user that the item has been successfully added to the cart. This mechanism allows users to build their order from the menu.

4. Cart Management
As the user adds dishes to their cart, the app maintains a running list of selected items. This list is shown on the "Checkout Screen," where users can review the dishes they plan to purchase. The cart contains:

Dish Name: The name of each dish in the cart.
Price: The price of each dish.
This part of the app is essential for managing the user’s order before proceeding to the checkout process.

5. Checkout Process
Once the user is satisfied with their order, they can proceed to checkout. The "Checkout Screen" displays:

List of Dishes: The items added to the cart, including each dish’s name and price.
Total Amount: The app calculates the total cost of all dishes in the cart. This total is presented to the user in a clear, prominent format.
After reviewing the total, the user can finalize the purchase. When they press the "Finalize Purchase" button, an alert will confirm that their order has been successfully placed. This step simulates completing a transaction and closing out the order.

6. App Flow and User Experience
Here’s a summary of the typical user flow through the app:

Step 1: The user opens the app and is welcomed by the "Home Screen."
Step 2: From the Home Screen, they can choose to add new menu items by navigating to the "Add Dish Screen," or they can browse existing dishes on the menu.
Step 3: The user views the menu and selects dishes to add to their cart. They are notified each time a dish is successfully added.
Step 4: After selecting their desired dishes, the user proceeds to checkout to view their cart and the total cost.
Step 5: The user confirms their purchase, and an alert notifies them that their order has been placed.
7. Key Features of the App
Dish Management: The app allows chefs to add new menu items quickly and efficiently, making it easy to keep the menu updated.
Cart Functionality: Users can easily add dishes to their cart, and the app automatically handles the pricing and total calculation.
Simple Navigation: The user interface is designed to be straightforward, with clear navigation between adding dishes, viewing the menu, and checking out.
Feedback Mechanisms: The app uses alerts to notify users of actions, such as successful dish addition to the cart and order completion, which helps guide the user through the process.
Checkout and Finalization: The checkout process is easy to understand, with a summary of the selected items and the total cost, giving users confidence that their order is correct before finalizing.
8. Error Handling and User Guidance
The app includes basic error handling to ensure that users enter valid information when adding dishes:

If the price is not a valid number or is left blank, an alert will prompt the user to enter a correct value.
If any fields (dish name, description, course, or price) are missing, the user will be alerted to complete the form.
This functionality ensures that the data input is correct, leading to a smooth user experience.

9. User Interface Design
The app's design is clean and intuitive, with the following UI elements:

Text Inputs: For entering dish details (name, description, course, price).
Buttons: To submit the dish or navigate between screens.
FlatList: To display the list of dishes available on the menu.
Alerts: To provide immediate feedback to the user, such as when a dish is added to the cart or when an order is placed.
10. Technical Overview
State Management: The app uses React's useState hook to manage the state of different components, such as the list of dishes, cart items, and input fields.
Navigation: The app uses React Navigation to allow users to move between different screens, such as the "Home Screen," "Add Dish Screen," and "Checkout Screen."
FlatList: This component is used to render a scrollable list of dishes dynamically. Each dish is represented by a name and price, and users can interact with the list by selecting dishes to add to their cart.
Alert Handling: The app utilizes the Alert component from React Native to provide feedback and confirmation dialogs for user actions.
11. Conclusion
This app provides a streamlined process for chefs and restaurant owners to manage and update their menu. It offers an intuitive experience for users to select dishes, build an order, and finalize purchases. By allowing easy addition of new dishes and handling error cases like invalid price input, the app ensures a smooth and effective way of managing restaurant orders. With clear feedback mechanisms, such as alerts for successful actions, users can confidently navigate and complete their tasks within the app.# chef
